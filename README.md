## Introduction
The ROVU system contains rovers, robots, that autonomously move within a designated environment. An interface allows an operator to monitor the environmental status that rovers perform their missions in, and display the positions of the robots and reward points. The missions performed by the rovers may change over time according to the environment, where each mission is composed of strategies that follow sequential points. The rovers use their proximity sensors to avoid environmental obstacles or running into each other. Furthermore, they communicate through a central station or with each other, as a possible part of the obstacle avoidance.

## Organization
This repository is divided into three main folders as the followed archituctural style:

**1. Model:** Where the code for the systems components(objects) are stored. 

**2. View:** On this folder all the code used for the graphical user interfaces can be found.

**3. Controller:** Where all the logical source code is available, including links to other repositories can be found in the classes headers if any is used.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and run on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
